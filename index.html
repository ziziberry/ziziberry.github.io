                                <p>The undergraduate social life at Harvard College spans a wide range of organizations and interests, encompassing a diverse student body of around 6,700 undergraduates from 50 states and over 80 countries. According to Harvard’s website, there are “over 400 official student organizations including extracurricular, co-curricular and athletic opportunities in addition to academics”. In terms of the “party scene”, many of these groups serve both a practical and social purpose, with various clubs hosting campus-wide parties and social functions. Particularly noteworthy is the College Events Board, which plans annual events open to the entire campus, including YardFest, a Spring concert in Tercentenary Theater (Old Harvard Yard), and Camp Harvard, a Fall back-to-school outdoors BBQ. Certain student dorms which have large, party-friendly suites also host open parties, while unofficial, primarily social organizations, including the unrecognized single-gender social organizations (USGSOs) in question, i.e. final clubs (Harvard-specific) and Greek organizations (affiliated with broader national associations). </p>

                                <p>The social sanctions are a faculty-driven initiative to institute penalties on USGSOs, Unrecognized Single Gender Social Organizations. The Committee on the Unrecognized Single-Gender Social Organizations defended the sanctions as part of Harvard College’s commitment to non-discrimination, inclusion, and a healthy social climate. Under these sanctions, participants in USGSOs will no longer be eligible for College-endorsed fellowships, leadership positions, and captaincies. This policy is to apply to students entering Harvard College starting in the fall of 2018 (Class of 2022). All currently enrolled undergraduates are exempt from the effects of this policy for the duration of their time at Harvard. An expansion of the original proposal has called for an outright ban on social groups and phased out from the campus completely by the year 2022.</p>

For example, liberal arts colleges including Amherst, Bowdoin, Williams and Middlebury, have generally decided to ban fraternity and sorority life...Overall, these institutions have consistently viewed social life organized by gender as incompatible with creating an inclusive campus. Those institutions that have had the most success addressing the influence of single gender social organizations and fraternity systems did so by taking bold steps to implement policies that eliminated the presence of such organizations combined with significant investment in alternatives including re-organizing their residential systems to promote and institutionalize inclusive social communities. Those that took half measures or changed course did not realize the same level of positive change in the undergraduate experience."</p>
